			<h2>About Wine Spectator Apps</h2>
			<p>Wine Spectator is the world&rsquo;s leading authority on wine, delivering expert reviews of more than 15,000 wines each year, including tasting notes, scores and recommendations on when to drink. Our all-star team of senior editors has spent more than 140 years collectively covering the world of wine, from the vineyard to the table. Our readers are passionate, well-informed, eager to learn and enthusiastic about sharing their experiences.</p>
			<p>Our app team is dedicated to bringing Wine Spectator&rsquo;s expertise, educational resources and handy interactive tools to desktop, tablet and mobile platforms. The free VintageChart+ was our first entrance into the smartphone app market, providing an easy-to-use reference to vintage quality. We followed up with our Guide to Napa Valley for the iPad, a trip planner with editors&rsquo; recommendations on the region&rsquo;s best places to visit and top-scoring wines. We&rsquo;ve got more exciting products on the way&hellip;.</p>
